			<h1>Casio F-91W</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the second blog post! Today I am writing about my favourite watch I own which is the Casio F-91W. Now I will say I am in no way affiliated with Casio despite that being quite obvious I feel like I should throw that out there. I picked up the watch nearly 7 months ago now and it is one of my favourite accessories I own.</p>

         	<p>The watch only cost me £10 and is a genuine model, as for some reason there are plenty of fake versions of this inexpensive digital watch? However, you can verify if your Casio is genuine by holding the bottom right button for 3 seconds, if the Casio logo then the watch is a genuine model. One of my favourite aspects of the watch is the fact that you don't really notice it while you are wearing it. Before this watch I had a Samsung Galaxy Fit2 and as much as I liked the watch I could never sleep while wearing it as I could constantly feel it rubbing my wrist where as the Casio fits firmly around my wrist and with its lightweight feel you tend to forget its on until you hear the hourly alarm. </p>

         	<p>Personally I am a fan of the hourly alarm which I know it is not for everyone however, I find that its not too loud or obnoxious so it doesn't disturb my sleep, it can be awkward if it goes off in class for example a lecture, it is quite easy to disable if necessary though. As I mentioned my previous watch was the Samsung Galaxy Fit2 now the watch wasn't a bad watch it was nice to have however, at the time of purchasing the Casio I was going through a Social Media detox and I found that the Casio was a great way to stop myself from checking my phone as I wouldn't be distracted by notifications when checking the time. I find myself often checking my watch instead of checking my phone now as I built it into habit despite no longer being on the Social Media detox. </p>

         	<p>Overall I do highly recommend picking up a Casio F-91W as there is no reason not to, the watch is sold all over the world for cheap and you can find it anywhere so if you are looking for a basic digital watch then I would recommend the F-91W.</p>
         	<p>Thanks for reading my second blog post I plan on posting a bit more in the future so keep your eyes out for the next post!</p>
         	<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
