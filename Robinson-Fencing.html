    <h1>Robinson Fencing</h1>
    <p>This was my first ever paid Website that I designed, I made this website using WordPress which I gained experience from in my Online Tools: Programming and Web-Design module at the University of Huddersfield. The owner of Robinson Fencing Darren had a website although the website was quite dated having been made in Seriff Web Plus meaning it was not mobile friendly as it had no media screen width properties within the CSS of the site. As well as this the site was running on a pretty old PHP version which made it vulnerable.</p>

    <style>
    .borderaroundtext {
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}

img {
  max-width: 100%;
  max-height: 100%;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  .borderaroundtext {
    flex-direction: row;
  }
  
  img {
    max-width: 50%;
    max-height: 100%;
  }
}
</style>
    <p>This is an example screenshot of the website which I got from the WayBackMachine. Do not get me wrong the site did everything the business needed and had plenty of good information that a potential customer may need the main problem was it was hard to keep up to date due to the nature of the software used to make it.</p>
    <p>When updating the site my main goal was to make it as mobile friendly as I could and so that the website was easier to maintain, WordPress is a perfect platform for this as it makes the whole process of updating text and pictures far easier than any other web-design software I have experienced. As well as this WordPress natively makes the websites on their platform mobile friendly which is absolutely necessary in this day and age because a good majority of web browsing is done via mobile devices. </p>

    <p>This is the Website in the present day which has a much more modern look to it, as well as this the site is far more optimised on smaller devices. </p>
