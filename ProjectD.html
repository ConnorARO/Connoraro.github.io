    <h1>Project. D</h1>
    <p>Project. D is a webiste I made for my university module Digital Activism Fandom and Participatory Media. The second assignment of this module required us to produce some form of fan work whether that be fan-art, a fan-video or a fan-website. I chose to make a fan-website for the popular anime series Initial D. I based my design upon the design of the website we see in the anime as I really liked the design and thought that it would be nice to make a website that has a similar aesthetic as there are websites that exist to replicate it but they are no longer available on the internet. </p>

}

<p>The website was made using WordPress, similar to the Robinson Fencing website I opted to use this as it was a cheaper and easier way of making a website for a university project. As well as this WordPress.com provides free hosting so it would save me money on a domain and it would save me from having to find a suitable place to host the website, unlike this site where the hosting is free as I host it from GitHub due to the lack of a back-end.</p>
<p>I didbn't want to make the website anything crazy or anything out of the ordinary I simply wanted the site to work which is why i designed it the way I did, with the text and images in the centre and the navigation on the side. The red colour is the same shade of red that is used on the Japanese flag which really suits the aesthetic of the site considering that the Initial D show comes from Japan.</p>
