                            <h2>Connor Alan; Photographer for hire in West Yorkshire.</h2>
                            <p>‘Avant Garde Street and Documentary Photographer.’</p>
                            <p>Growing up in West Yorkshire, Connor is a third year student at University; with a background in videography he found his passion for photography in 2022 after photographing an open deck rave in Huddersfield. Eventually finding an interest in street photography whilst exploring the Leeds area. Now Connor uses his photography to express his view of the world and capturing life as it happens in his own unique way.

                            Photography has found him exploring the country and beyond, pushing him out of his comfort zone, venturing to a variety of places such as London, York, Birmingham and Kinsale. </p>

                            <p> In 2023, Connors photographic abilities were truly tested when undergoing his year in industry as a professional videographer and photographer for a large scale local business working in their design and communications department.

                            Connors black and white photography is inspired by the ‘Are-Bure-Boke’ style that was popular amongst photographers such as Daido Moriyama and Shomei Tomatsu while the colour work he produces is inspired by many of the modern day street photographers such as Trevor Wisecup, Brian Lloyd Duckett and Joel Meyerowitz. Often using the style of these photographers to create his own unique voice in the world.</p>

                            <p>Since starting his photographic career Connors work has been featured on <a href="https://www.ilfordphoto.com/friday-favourites-funonfilm-2023/"> <b> Ilfords Friday Favourites #Funonfilm2023 </b> and <a href="https://www.ilfordphoto.com/friday-favourites-home/"> <b> Ilfords Friday Favourites #Home. </b></a> You can find more of his work on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/connorarr/"> <b> Instagram</a></b>.</p>
