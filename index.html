			<h3>> About Me<span class="blink_me">_</span></h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Connor I am a Web-Developer currently studying Digital Media at the Univeristy of Huddersfield. My interests in web-design began back in 2021 when I undertook a class in web design for my first year at university, my interests within coding and development first peaked when I was 13 years old initially writing up 'text-based games' in batch then progressing onto languages such as: VBS C# JS HTML and CSS.
This webstite will be used to highlight my work experience within the industry, as well as acting as my own personal space on the internet where I can blog and share my thoughts. <br>

	<p><strong> Robinson Fencing: October 2022 - December 2022 </strong></p>
	<p>Robinson Fencing approached me looking to update their website and make it more SEO friendly. Since websites are beginning to heavily cater towards mobile browsers, Darren noticed his website did not suit a mobile browser. I took his website and redesigned it using WordPress, modernising it and making it more friendly not only for mobile users but for all users of the website.</p>

	<p><strong> Online Tools, Programming and Web design: January 2022 - April 2022 </strong></p>
	<p>During my first year of University I studied under  Dr. Dağhan Irak who introduced me to the concept of Web Design where I very quickly fell in love with the subject. We were tasked with making a website using WordPress.org about a subject we were passionate about. My website was based around Japanese cars and featured a live twitter feed on the side bar, a blog and various galleries that had pinterest embeds.</p>
