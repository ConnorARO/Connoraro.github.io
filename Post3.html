			<h1>Finishing second year of university!</h1>
			<p>So as of the 22nd of May 2023 I am officially done with my second year at university! All my papers have been submitted and I am eagerly awaiting for results day on the 20th of June. So as of right now I am enjoying the start of summer till I begin my placement year on the 3rd of July, assuming I get my desired results in June then I can go onto my third year where I will be working within the media industry as an in-house videographer for a local company. Once I finish the placement in June 2024 I can go on to do my final year of university then I can graduate in 2025. </p>

			<p>I have considered studying a masters after finishing my undergraduate degree in digital media and communications however, I am yet to decide as the idea of jumping straight into industry post graduation really appeals to me. At the University of Huddersfield I do have the option to do a masters in media as they offer a post-graduate course titled 'Digital and Social Media' which does interest me but I do think I will have to consider it later down the line. </p>

			<p>So during this small break from University I am going to continue working my part time job at McDonalds, work on the website and work on my videography and photography skills to ready myself for July while I anxiously await results day on the 20th of June, so keep your fingers crossed for me!</p>
